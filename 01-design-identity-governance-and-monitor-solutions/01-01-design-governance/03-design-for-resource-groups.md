# AZ-305: Design for Resource Groups (Enhanced Content)

---

## What Are Resource Groups?

- **Resource Groups** are logical containers where Azure resources such as web apps, databases, virtual machines, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
- They help organize resources based on **usage, type, location, or life cycle**.
- Resource groups enable:
  - Grouping related resources to create, update, or delete as a single unit.
  - Applying role-based access control (RBAC) at the group level.
  - Using resource locks to protect critical resources from accidental deletion or modification.

---

## Key Characteristics of Resource Groups

- Each resource group has a **location (region)** — this is where the group's metadata is stored.
- If the resource group’s region is temporarily unavailable, **resource updates fail**, but the resources themselves continue to operate normally.
- Resources within a resource group **can be located in different regions**.
- Resources in different resource groups can **connect to each other** (e.g., web app in one group connects to a database in another).
- Resources **can be moved** between resource groups with some limitations.
- A resource belongs to **exactly one resource group**.
- Resource groups **cannot be nested** and **cannot be renamed**.

## Design Considerations When Creating Resource Groups

### Organizational Strategies

- **Group by Type**  
  Organize resources by type rather than application.  
  Example: One resource group for all SQL databases (`SQL-RG`), another for all web apps (`WEB-RG`).

- **Group by Application**  
  Group all resources for a single application in the same resource group to align with similar policies and life cycle.  
  Example: Separate resource groups for `App1` and `App2`, each containing all app-related resources.

- **Other Grouping Options**  
  Consider grouping by:
  - Department
  - Location (region)
  - Billing or cost center

- **Combine Strategies**  
  Often a combination of the above methods provides the best organizational structure.

### Life Cycle Management

- Group resources that share the **same deployment, update, and deletion cycles** together.
- This enables easier management of the resource life cycle.

### Administrative Overhead

- Plan how many resource groups you want to manage.
- Decide if administration will be **centralized** or **decentralized**.
- More resource groups mean more overhead but finer-grained control.

### Access Control & Security

- Apply **Azure policies, RBAC roles, and resource locks** at the resource group level.
- Resource locks prevent **accidental deletion or modification** of critical resources.

### Compliance Considerations

- Determine if metadata for resource groups needs to be stored in specific regions to meet compliance.
- Design resource group locations accordingly.

## Example: Tailwind Traders Resource Group Design

- Two applications (`App1` and `App2`) each with:
  - Web services
  - SQL databases
  - Virtual machines
  - Storage accounts
- Options:
  - Group by app: Separate resource groups for `App1` and `App2` (each containing all resources).
  - Group by type: Separate resource groups for databases and web services (e.g., `SQL-RG` and `WEB-RG`).
- Decide based on policies, life cycles, administration, and compliance.

| Concept                     | Description                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource Group              | Logical container for managing Azure resources as a unit           |
| Location (Region)           | Location of the metadata for the resource group                    |
| Resource Placement          | Resources can be in different regions within a single resource group |
| Resource Group Limits       | Cannot be nested, renamed; resource belongs to one resource group only |
| Grouping Strategies         | By type, application, department, location, billing, or hybrid    |
| Life Cycle Management       | Group resources with similar deployment and update cycles         |
| Administrative Overhead     | Balance number of resource groups with management complexity      |
| Access Control & Locks      | Use RBAC and locks to secure resource groups and prevent changes  |
| Compliance                 | Consider metadata location and policies to meet compliance needs  |
