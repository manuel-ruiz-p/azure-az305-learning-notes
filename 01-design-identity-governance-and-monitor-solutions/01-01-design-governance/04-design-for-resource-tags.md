# AZ-305: Design for Resource Tags (Enhanced Content)

---

## What Are Resource Tags?

- **Resource Tags** provide metadata as **name-value pairs** to organize and manage Azure resources.
- Tags add extra information to resources, resource groups, or subscriptions.
- Examples: `env=production`, `department=finance`.

---

## Key Characteristics of Resource Tags

- Tags consist of **name-value pairs**.
- Multiple tags can be assigned to each resource, resource group, or subscription.
- Tags can be **added, modified, or deleted** using:
  - PowerShell
  - Azure CLI
  - ARM templates
  - REST API
  - Azure Portal
- Tags applied to a **resource group are not inherited** by resources within it.

## Important Planning Tips for Resource Tagging

- **Define goals before tagging**: What will the tags enable?  
  E.g., better search, automation, compliance, billing.
- **Align tags with organizational taxonomy**:  
  Use recognized department names, compliance terms, or cost centers.
- **Decide on tagging alignment**:  
  - **IT-aligned tags** focus on operational aspects like workload or environment.  
  - **Business-aligned tags** focus on cost, ownership, and business value.
- **Start small and scale**: Prototype with critical tags first, then expand.
- **Enforce tagging consistency with Azure Policy**:  
  Use policies to require tags on resource creation or reapply tags if deleted.
- **Tagging doesnâ€™t have to apply to all resources**:  
  For example, only mission-critical resources may have certain tags.

## Tagging Alignment Options

| Alignment       | Description                                                | Example Scenario                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IT-aligned      | Tracks workload, environment, function, and operational needs | Tailwind Traders tracks printer workload to decide on purchases     |
| Business-aligned| Tracks accounting, ownership, cost, and business impact    | Marketing department tracks printing costs linked to sales revenue  |

## Types of Resource Tags

| Tag Type       | Description                                | Example Name-Value Pairs                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional     | Categorizes resources by purpose/function | `app=catalogsearch1`, `tier=web`, `env=production`   |
| Classification | Identifies resource usage                   | `confidentiality=private`, `SLA=24hours`             |
| Accounting     | Associates resource with billing groups    | `department=finance`, `program=business-initiative` |
| Partnership    | Identifies resource stakeholders            | `owner=jsmith`, `contactalias=catsearchowners`       |
| Purpose        | Links resource to business functions        | `businessprocess=support`, `revenueimpact=high`      |

## Best Practices

- Use tags aligned with business needs and IT operations.
- Engage stakeholders from across the organization when designing tags.
- Use Azure Policy to maintain tag consistency.
- Consider impact and relevance before tagging every resource.
- Regularly review and update the tagging strategy as the organization evolves.

## Summary Table

| Concept                    | Description                                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tag Format                 | Name-value pairs (e.g., `env=production`)                           |
| Scope                      | Resources, resource groups, subscriptions                           |
| Tag Inheritance            | Tags on resource groups **do not** propagate to individual resources|
| Tag Management Tools       | Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates, REST API             |
| Alignment Strategy         | IT-aligned vs. Business-aligned tagging                             |
| Tag Categories             | Functional, classification, accounting, partnership, purpose       |
| Enforcement                | Use Azure Policy to require or enforce tagging                     |
| Implementation Approach    | Start with critical tags, scale as needed                          |
