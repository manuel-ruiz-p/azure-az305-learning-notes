# Designing Service Principals for Applications

**Enhanced AZ-305 Study Guide**

---

## Overview & Context

In Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID), **security principals** authenticate and authorize users and applications. For applications, **service principals** represent app identities within tenants and control app permissions and access to resources.

A solid understanding of service principals and their lifecycle is critical for designing secure, scalable identity architectures in Azure — a key skill for the AZ-305 exam.

## Core Concepts

### Application Object vs. Service Principal

* **Application Object**

  * The global app definition, registered once in the *home* Azure AD tenant.
  * Contains app metadata, authentication settings, API permissions, and branding.
  * Used as a template for creating service principals.
  * Exists *only* in the home tenant.

* **Service Principal**

  * Local representation of an application in a tenant where it runs.
  * Controls app access and permissions within that tenant.
  * Multiple service principals can reference the same app object across tenants (multitenancy).
  * Enables granular control over app permissions in each tenant.

### Types of Service Principals

| Type                 | Description                                                                                                    | Use Case                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Application**      | Standard app service principal linked to an app object. Created in each tenant where the app is used.          | Multitenant or single-tenant apps requiring delegated permissions. |
| **Managed Identity** | Automatically managed identity tied to an Azure resource (VM, App Service). No credential management required. | For Azure services accessing resources securely without secrets.   |
| **Legacy**           | Older style service principals before app registrations. Limited to home tenant, manually configured.          | Maintaining compatibility with legacy apps.                        |

## Key Relationships & Characteristics

* **1 App Object → 1 Software App** (in home tenant)
* **1 App Object → Many Service Principals** (one per tenant)
* Single-tenant apps have only one service principal.
* Multi-tenant apps have service principals in all tenant directories where used.
* Managed identities have service principals but cannot be manually altered.
* Legacy service principals are confined to the tenant they were created in.

---

## Creating and Managing Service Principals

* Service principals are created:

  * Automatically on app registration in Azure portal.
  * When a multitenant app is consented to in a new tenant.
  * Manually via Azure CLI, PowerShell, Microsoft Graph, or ARM templates.

* Managed identities are created when enabled on Azure resources and automatically create service principals.

---

## Best Practices & Considerations

### Permission Requests

* Use **least privilege principle**: Request only the permissions your app *needs*.
* Avoid requesting excessive permissions (e.g., Mail.ReadWrite when Mail.Read suffices).
* Handle consent denial gracefully with fallback or user notifications.

### User Consent Management

* **Restrict user consent** to apps from verified publishers or through admin consent policies.
* Centralize approval of app permissions by security/identity admins to minimize risk.
* This reduces the risk of unmanaged or malicious apps gaining access.

### Credential Management

* Prefer **managed identities** for Azure resources to avoid handling secrets.
* Use service principals without managed identities only when credential management is necessary (e.g., non-Azure resources).
* Rotate and safeguard credentials for service principals diligently.

## Real-World Scenario: Tailwind Traders

* Register app in home tenant → creates app object.
* When app accessed in multiple tenants → service principals created in each tenant.
* Managed identities assigned to Azure VMs → service principals auto-created, no manual management.
* Restrict user consent for external apps → security team reviews and approves.

- A) To globally define an application across all tenants  
- B) To represent a local instance of an application in a specific tenant and control access  
- C) To manage user passwords and credentials  
- D) To serve as the home directory for all app objects  

**Answer:** B) To represent a local instance of an application in a specific tenant and control access

---

**Which of the following service principal types provides an identity for Azure resources without requiring credential management?**

- A) Application service principal  
- B) Managed identity service principal  
- C) Legacy service principal  
- D) External service principal  

**Answer:** B) Managed identity service principal

---

**When is a service principal created automatically in Azure AD?**

- A) Only when an app is registered using PowerShell  
- B) When a multitenant app is consented to in a new tenant or when registered via the Azure portal  
- C) When a legacy app is migrated to Azure AD  
- D) Only when a user manually creates it in the tenant  

**Answer:** B) When a multitenant app is consented to in a new tenant or when registered via the Azure portal

---

**Which of the following is a best practice for requesting permissions for an app registered in Microsoft Entra ID?**

- A) Request the maximum permissions possible to avoid issues later  
- B) Request only permissions needed for current app functionality (least privilege)  
- C) Always request Mail.ReadWrite permissions for email access  
- D) Avoid handling scenarios where the user denies consent  

**Answer:** B) Request only permissions needed for current app functionality (least privilege)

---

**How can an organization restrict user consent for applications in Azure AD?**

- A) By disabling all user consent globally without exception  
- B) By allowing users to consent only to apps from verified publishers and using admin consent policies  
- C) By letting users consent to any app but auditing permissions daily  
- D) By deleting the app object after user consent  

**Answer:** B) By allowing users to consent only to apps from verified publishers and using admin consent policies
