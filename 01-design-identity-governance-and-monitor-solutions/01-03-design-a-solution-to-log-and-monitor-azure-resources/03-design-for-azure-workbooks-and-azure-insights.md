# üìò Design for Azure Workbooks and Azure Insights

## ‚úÖ Overview

**Azure Workbooks** are a component of **Azure Monitor** that enable data visualization and analysis across multiple sources. Combined with **Azure Insights**, which offer targeted monitoring experiences, Workbooks provide a powerful tool for centralized diagnostics, performance monitoring, and operational decision-making.

## üß† Key Concepts

### üìä Azure Workbooks

* **Interactive Dashboards**: Workbooks are flexible canvases in the Azure Portal for data visualization, exploration, and diagnostics.
* **Multi-source Data**: Can combine data from Logs, Metrics, Azure Resource Graph, Alerts, Resource Health, and more.
* **Custom Visuals**: Grid views, charts, conditional formatting, and parameterized reports.
* **Authoring Power**: Authors can ingest, transform, and model data for insight into performance, health, availability, and usage.

### üß© Data Sources Supported

* Logs
* Metrics
* Azure Resource Graph
* Alerts
* Workload Health
* Azure Resource Health
* Azure Data Explorer

### üí° Azure Insights

**Azure Insights** are pre-configured monitoring experiences focused on specific resources:

| Insight Type            | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Insights    | Tracks performance, usage, and exceptions in web apps.              |
| Container Insights      | Monitors container workloads in AKS or ACI.                         |
| Network Insights        | Tracks network health and dependencies.                             |
| VM Insights             | Tracks OS performance, dependencies, and workloads on VMs.          |
| Resource Group Insights | Provides contextual monitoring across all resources in a group.     |
| Azure Cache for Redis   | Reports latency, failures, capacity, and health of Redis instances. |
| Cosmos DB Insights      | Offers performance and operational metrics for Cosmos DB.           |
| Key Vault Insights      | Monitors access performance and failures.                           |
| Azure Storage Insights  | Unified view of storage metrics and performance.                    |

## üß≠ Best Practices

* Use **Workbooks** for:

  * Building **operational playbooks**
  * Performing **root cause analysis**
  * Unifying telemetry across services
  * Creating **team-specific dashboards**
* Use **Insights** for:

  * A **focused view** into the health and performance of particular services
  * Enabling **predefined metrics and alerting**
  * Identifying performance degradation early

## üîß Design Considerations

| Area                      | Recommendation                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Resource Views**  | Use Workbooks to visualize data across VMs, networks, and databases. |
| **Operational Playbooks** | Embed step-by-step diagnostic processes.                             |
| **Insights Integration**  | Leverage out-of-the-box dashboards for Cosmos DB, Redis, etc.        |
| **Access Control**        | Use Azure RBAC to control workbook visibility and access.            |


## üìå Summary

* **Use Workbooks** for custom dashboards, operational playbooks, and diagnostics.
* **Use Azure Insights** for out-of-the-box monitoring tailored to specific Azure services.
* Combine both for a comprehensive and scalable monitoring solution across environments.
