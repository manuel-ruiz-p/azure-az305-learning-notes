# üìò Design for Azure Data Explorer

## ‚úÖ Overview

**Azure Data Explorer (ADX)** is a high-performance big data analytics platform optimized for fast, real-time analysis of log and telemetry data. It supports large-scale ingestion, querying, visualization, and integration with tools such as **Azure Monitor**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, and **Azure Machine Learning**.

Tailwind Traders can use Azure Data Explorer as the foundation of a scalable and flexible **end-to-end monitoring and analytics solution**, especially when standard SaaS solutions fall short.

## üìä Integration Scenarios

### üß© With Azure Monitor

* Use Azure Monitor‚Äôs native tools for ingesting logs from VMs, Azure services, and hybrid infrastructure.
* Create dashboards and alerts using Monitor, while leveraging ADX for deeper custom analytics.

### üõ°Ô∏è With Microsoft Sentinel

* ADX can act as a long-term storage and analytics backend for Sentinel.
* Supports **application trace logs** and **custom telemetry** not natively handled by Sentinel.

### üß† With Azure Machine Learning

* Export trained ML models into ADX for real-time data scoring.
* Supports **forecasting**, **anomaly detection**, and **pattern recognition** across telemetry data.

## üìå Best Practices

* **Centralize logs**: Build a unified log repository in ADX to collect from cloud, on-premises, and third-party systems.
* **Hybrid ingestion**: Use both **streamed** and **batched** data pipelines.
* **Real-time insights**: Implement dashboards with real-time monitoring for rapid root cause analysis.
* **Complementary Use**: Combine with Azure Monitor and Sentinel for a layered monitoring strategy.
* **Long-Term Analysis**: Store historical logs in ADX for trend analysis, capacity planning, and compliance.
