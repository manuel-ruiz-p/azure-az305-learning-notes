# üõ°Ô∏è Design for Azure Backup

Azure Backup is a cloud-based solution that provides scalable and secure data protection for both cloud-based and on-premises workloads. It eliminates the need for managing physical backup infrastructure (e.g., tapes, hard drives, DVDs), making your backup solution more cost-effective and easier to manage.

## üîç Key Concepts

* **Azure Backup uses Azure resources** for both short-term and long-term data retention.
* It offers multiple backup **components (agents)** depending on the workload you're protecting.
* Backup data is stored in a **vault**, which manages recovery points, backup policies, and more.
* Backup options cover a wide range of scenarios‚Äîfrom simple file/folder backup to full VM and database protection.

## üíæ Types of Backups Supported

| **Backup Type**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-premises**                      | Protect files, folders, and system state using the **Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS)** agent. Use **DPM** or **MABS** to protect Hyper-V/VMware VMs. |
| **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**     | Back up full Windows or Linux VMs using backup extensions. Alternatively, use the MARS agent for file-level and system state backups.                         |
| **Azure Files**                      | Back up **Azure file shares** to a specified storage account.                                                                                                 |
| **SQL Server on Azure VMs**          | Perform database-level backups of **SQL Server** running on Azure VMs.                                                                                        |
| **SAP HANA on Azure VMs**            | Back up **SAP HANA databases** hosted in Azure VMs.                                                                                                           |
| **Microsoft Cloud-native workloads** | Replace legacy on-prem/off-site solutions with cloud-based backup strategies that are reliable, secure, and cost-effective.                                   |

## üóÉÔ∏è Azure Backup Storage Vaults

Azure Backup stores all backup data in **vaults**, which act as secure containers for policies and recovery points.

### üß∞ Vault Types

| **Vault Type**                    | **Used For**                           | **Supported Data Sources**                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure Backup Vault**            | Exclusive to Azure Backup              | Azure Blobs, Azure Disks, Azure Database for PostgreSQL                                |
| **Azure Recovery Services Vault** | Used with Azure Backup & Site Recovery | Azure VMs, SQL & SAP HANA on Azure VMs, Azure File Shares, DPM, MABS, and MARS backups |

## üß† Key Planning Considerations

| **Consideration**         | **Details**                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vault Organization**    | Use one vault if managing from a single subscription/resource group. Use multiple if workloads span multiple subscriptions. |
| **Azure Policy**          | Apply **Azure Policy** to enforce consistent backup policies across multiple vaults. Policies are **scoped to a vault**.    |
| **Role-Based Protection** | Use **Azure RBAC** to define and control access to backup vaults securely.                                                  |
| **Redundancy Options**    | Select replication strategy for backup data:                                                                                |
|                           | - **LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)**: Protects against single datacenter failures.                                         |
|                           | - **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)**: Protects against entire regional outages by replicating data to a secondary region.      |

## üèÅ Summary

Azure Backup enables organizations like **Tailwind Traders** to implement a **cost-effective, secure, and scalable** backup and recovery solution for various workloads‚Äîwhether on-premises or in the cloud. With support for multiple backup types and the use of vaults, you can create a unified and policy-driven approach to business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR).
