# Describe Hybrid Solutions ‚Äì AZ-305 Study Guide

## Overview

Hybrid solutions combine **on-premises infrastructure** with **cloud-based resources**, enabling flexibility, resilience, and support for both legacy and modern applications. In the context of SQL Server and Azure, hybrid architectures are primarily used for **high availability (HA)** and **disaster recovery (DR)**, especially during **cloud migration** or to **extend existing datacenters**.

---

## Key Concepts

### üîÑ Recovery Objectives

* **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable time for restoring operations after a failure.
* **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time.

Understanding RTO and RPO helps determine the right architecture and technologies to meet business continuity goals.

## üß© Hybrid Architecture Scenarios

### 1. **Hybrid Architecture Definition**

A hybrid architecture spans on-premises and Azure (or even other clouds), allowing systems to continue functioning despite partial failures or outages.

---

### 2. **Use Cases for Hybrid HA/DR**

* DR extension for on-prem SQL Server using Azure.
* Migration step from on-prem to full cloud deployment.
* Cross-cloud HA (e.g., AWS ‚Üí Azure).

---

### 3. **Limitations of PaaS in Hybrid**

* Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance **do not support traditional hybrid AG or FCI scenarios**.
* PaaS is managed by Azure and abstracts most of the infrastructure, limiting integration with on-prem HADR technologies.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Exception:**
You can use **SQL Server transactional replication** from an **on-premises publisher** to an **Azure SQL Managed Instance subscriber**. However, replication **does not work in reverse**.

---

### 4. **Hybrid IaaS-based Solutions**

Most hybrid HADR solutions must use **SQL Server in IaaS (VMs)** to retain control over clustering, replication, and configuration.

**Example:**

* On-prem AG ‚Üí Secondary replica in Azure.
* Requires configuration of:

  * **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
  * **DNS**
  * **Quorum voting**

---

### 5. **Networking Considerations**

Reliable, fast, and secure networking is essential to meet HADR objectives:

* **Azure ExpressRoute:** Private, dedicated high-throughput connection between on-prem and Azure.
* **Site-to-Site VPN:** Secure alternative if ExpressRoute is unavailable.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid exposing Azure VMs to the public internet.**

---

### 6. **Backup and Archival Storage**

* Azure can serve as:

  * Destination for **SQL Server backups**.
  * Cold storage/archive location using **Azure Blob Storage**.

Even if it's not a full hybrid architecture, **using Azure for backups** enhances disaster recovery posture.

## üìò Best Practices

* Always define and test your RTO and RPO targets.
* Use ExpressRoute for enterprise-grade hybrid networking.
* Do not expose IaaS SQL Server VMs to the public internet.
* Leverage Azure storage for cost-effective, secure backup storage.
